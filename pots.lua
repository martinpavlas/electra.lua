-- Pot reading demo
--
-- Electra One features 12 high-resolution 360-degree pots. The pot readings are
-- always relative, providing information about the rate of change. The rate
-- increases with speed of the rotation. The positive rates represent clockwise
-- rotation while negative rates are counter-clockwise.
--
-- The callback function is called whenever a change of position is detected.
--
-- The pots are identified with a numeric identifier, starting with id 1
-- for the leftmost pot in the first row and going up to 12 for
-- the rightmost pot in the second row. The global variables POT_1 .. POT_12
-- are provided to identify the pots.
