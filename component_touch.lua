-- The component touch demo
--
-- The touchEvent data table provided in LCD touch callbacks does not provide
-- only the screen coordinates. if the active touch point is within the
-- boundaries of a component, a component identifier is provided.
-- This simplifies handling of the touch events.
--
-- The current Lua implementation is purposely limited to having the component
-- identifier in the touchEvent data table. This means that if actions are to
-- be taken with the component it needs to be looked up by the Id. I want to
-- change this so that the reference to the component is provided directly in
-- the touchEvent as a Lua user data object / meta table. I still need to find
-- out how to do that.
