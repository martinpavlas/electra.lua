-- Pot touch sensing demo
--
-- Electra One features touch sensing hardware pots (knobs). Callback calls
-- are triggered whenever the fingers are put down or lifted of the pots.
--
-- The pots are identified with a numeric identifier, starting with id 1
-- for the leftmost pot in the first row and going up to 12 for
-- the rightmost pot in the second row. The global variables POT_1 .. POT_12
-- are provided to identify the pots.

    if potId == POT_1 then
        print ("POT_1 touched")
    end

function onPotTouchUp (potId)
    print ("pot " .. potId .. " released")
